# Stories
Stories is a web app designed to mimic book reading.  The original idea was to offer families an online story book repository so they wouldn't have to track down books in the library or a book that could be lost in the house.  The story progresses at the readers own pace with the push of a button in the Angular framework.  At the moment the stories themselves are stored on Firebase as strings.  Once a story is selected the string is pulled down and parsed into an array.  Each item in the array is then displayed in turn (advanced by the "page turn" buttons) to show the story.  There is also a checkbox which when clicked will activate MP3 files to play with the page turning.  Each MP3 file is recorded and lined up to match the written words of the story to give parents another option in reading the story to their kids should the parent be sick and can't speak very well.  This was accomplished using a simple Angular audio tag.
